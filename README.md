# nsfw-score-and-model-filter

This is a python script created to sort and filter images, mainly generated images from stable diffusion, based on their nsfw probability, score and class, model name and/or their parameters from generation.

## Requirements

## Filtering tyes
There are currently 4 types of filtering available:
- NSFW probability
- Score
- Model (stable diffusion)
- Parameter(s) (positive prompt)

## NSFW probability

## Scoring models
There are several image scorer available:
- Xception
- VGG16
- VGG19
- ResNet50
- ResNet50V2
- ResNet101
- ResNet101V2
- ResNet152
- ResNet152V2
- InceptionV3
- InceptionResNetV2
- MobileNet
- MobileNetV2
- DenseNet121
- DenseNet169
- DenseNet201
- NASNetMobile
- NASNetLarge
- EfficientNetB0
- EfficientNetB1
- EfficientNetB2
- EfficientNetB3
- EfficientNetB4
- EfficientNetB5
- EfficientNetB6
- EfficientNetB7
- EfficientNetV2B0
- EfficientNetV2B1
- EfficientNetV2B2
- EfficientNetV2B3
- EfficientNetV2S
- EfficientNetV2M
- EfficientNetV2L
- ConvNeXtTiny
- ConvNeXtSmall
- ConvNeXtBase
- ConvNeXtLarge
